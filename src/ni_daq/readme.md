# NI-DAQ package 

## purpose of this package

The main purpose is to create a message type for the daq card. "code_equipment" package script, "ros_ni_daq_talker.py" publish through rosbridge with the message types definded in "msg" folder.

Do not worry about things in src, those are just some dummy files. What's inside msg is way more imoportant. Check out ros tutorials on how to build a message. If you just want to collect 4 signals or less, you can just use the code I provided and no further modification is required.
